<h1>DESTINATION</h1>

Suppose that this is /benadm/, which has just been moved
from shared-web.moc.com to mweb.fdy.moc.com.

It may contain relative links to stuff that still sits on
shared-web, so those need to become fully-qualified links.

It may also contain fully-qualified links to itself, which
can be simplified.

Should stay as /moc_confid.html
