@=head1 NAME

swconv - ``Shared-Web'' converter.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

swconv [options] directory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

swconv was designed for use at Marathon Oil Company
(http://www.marathon.com/). (The name ``swconv'' is historical only.)

swconv is a utility to make moving large directory trees of web
content from one virtual server (or directory) to another easier.

Every once in a while, the need arises to move web content from on
virtual server to another. When that happens, the publisher or
webmaster is left with the daunting task of changing/fixing/updating
lots of hyperlinks that broke as a result of the move.

Unfortunately, the process of fixing those links is quite tedious and
error prone when attempted manually. One must be sure to check (and
possibly update references on the old an new virtual server. One must
check all places where there might have been links to the moved
content, the moved content itself may have broken links to content
that used to be ``relative'' (because it was on the old virtual
server), and so on.

swconv makes this process easier. It is designed to be run after the
web content has been moved from the old virtual server to the new one
and before any manual attempts to update the links have been
attempted.

swconv scans for links embedded in these tags:

   <IMG...>
   <A...>
   <LINK...>
   <FORM...>
   <INPUT...>

You will need to give swconv a fair amount of information about your
setup. This can be accompished either with command-line options (see
``OPTIONS'' below) or via a configuration file specified with the
``--config'' option (not yet implemented).

One may simply invoke swconv with some command-line options (see
``OPTIONS'' below) to customize its behavior and the path to the directory
which needs to be processed.

After reading through the available options, you should read the
``EXAMPLES'' section for ideas of how to use swconv when.

=head1 OPTIONS

wclogrot can take a combination of many command-line options. All
options begin with a double-dash (--). Some take mandatory parameters,
while others are simple flags to enable a certain option.

The available options are:

B<--logfile> ``/path/to/file''

I<NOT IMPLEMENTED YET>

The location and file in which you'd like swconv to put messages. If
a log file is specified, nothing will be printed to STDOUT unless a
problem creeps up. If you specify the ``C<--verbose>'' flag, it will
increase the verbosity of the messgaes put into this file.

B<--debug>

Enable the output of debugging messages to STDOUT. This is really
only useful for development or if you are trying to track down a
problem. The debugging messages should give you a good idea of what
is happening as swconv goes through its motions.  Debugging is
disabled by default. Debugging is not automatically redirected to a
log file when the ``C<--logfile>'' option is used. You must redirect
debugging messages from the shell if you wish to capture them.

B<--backup>

Enable the creation of backup files. Every file that is modified will
be backed up by appending a backup suffix to the full name of hte file
(see the ``C<--backup-suffix>'' option, below). I<Backups are disabled
by default>.

B<--backup-suffix "blah">

I<NOT IMPLEMENTED YET>

Use this as the backup suffix. (See the ``C<--backup>'' option, above)
for details about what this does. The default value of backup-suffix
is ``.bak''

B<--test>

Tell swconv to run in test mode. It will go through all the motions,
respecting other swtiches you've set, but when it comes to commit the
changes to disk, it will not rewrite any files. This is useful for
pre-scanning directories to see what the impact of running swconv will
be.

Please use this flag when you're testing things. Depending on the
``C<--backup>'' option isn't always what you want to do.

B<--old-url-prefix> "http://www.some.thing/foo/"

I<Required>

Tell swconv the URL prefix of the old content location. This
defaults to null, so is required that you set this option.

B<--new-url-prefix> "http://www.new.thing/bar/"

I<Required>

Tell swconv the URL prefix of the new content location. This
defaults to null, so it is required that you set this option.

B<--dir-is-source>

Tell swconv that the directory you've specified is the source
(meaning that it may contain links to the moved content). Source is
where links start. This cannot be set if ``C<dir-is-destination>''is
set or an error will result.

B<--dir-is-destination>

Tell swconv that the directory you've specified is the destination
(meaning that it contains the moved content). Destination is where
the links will go. This cannot be set if ``C<dir-is-source>'' is
set or an error will result.

B<--help>

Display a brief help message to remind you of command-line
arguments. This won't happen by default.

B<directory>

The directory name/path that you specify may contain either ``C</>''
or ``C<\>'' as path separators (Unix or DOS style). They will be
converted properly internally.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Following are several examples of using swconv in different
situations. In cases when the command-line arguments are quite long,
lines are broken up with trailig backslahes (``\'').

=head2 Example #1

You have moved content from C</www/companyX/products> to
C</www/companyZ/products>, which are hosted as
http://www.companyX.com/products and http://www.companyZ.com/products
respectively.

You move the content and remove the C</www/companyX/products directory>.

There may be links in C</www/companyX/about_us> which refer to pages in
what is now C</www/companyZ/products>, but the links don't know that.

To update any links in C</www/companyX/about_us>, do the following:

  cd /www/companyX
  swconv --dir-is-source \
         --old-url-prefix "http://www.companyX.com/products/" \
         --new-url-prefix "http://www.companyZ.com/products/" \
         --backup about_us

There may also be links in C</www/comapnyZ/products> which refer to
pages in what is now on a different virtual server, the stuff still
sitting in C</www/companyX/>.

To adjust those links, do the following:

  cd /www/companyZ
  swconv --dir-is-destination \
         --old-url-prefix "http://www.companyX.com/products/" \
         --new-url-prefix "http://www.companyZ.com/products/" \
         --backup products

Both of those sets of commands will produce backup files in those
directories. Only files which change are backed up.

=head2 Example #2

This needs to be a more clever example of using swconv usage.

It's a bit too late in the evening for me to come up with one, so let
me know if you think of anything.

=head1 BUGS

Note: swconv makes fairly extensive attempts to trap most trappable
errors. In the event of a problem, it will print a failure notice and
exit with a non-zero exit code.

I should add a ``C<--sleep-between-files>'' option that can call
C<sleep()> between processing files. This will make it less of a CPU
hog at the expense of the process taking a bit longer.

swconv can only process one directory tree at a time. You may need to
write a small script to have it hit lots of peer directory trees (util
I add the necessary code to handle multiple directory names on the
command-line).

Also, this may or may not be a bug, depending on your point of
view. swconv I<does not parse> the HTML file(s). It simply applies
some clever regexes to the file based on the command-line arguments
you supply. I<It does not know about embedded code such as
JavaScript>. Commented chunks of HTML may get adjusted when you don't
want them to.

  Tell wclogrot how many ``old'' log files you'd like to keep. This
  does not count the new log that will be created after rotation. If
  you specify ``--keep 3'' for rotating /var/log/messages, you will
  eventually end up with messages.0, messages.1, and
  messages.2. During each rotation, log files older that specified
  will be removed. File ``age'' is determined by the suffix, not the
  actual timestamp. The default value for keep is 1.

wclogrot - Rotate Log Files
d7 1
a7 1
wclogrot [options] /path/to/file
d11 2
a12 2
wclogrot was designed for use on the Wood County FreeNet,
<http://www.wcnet.org/>.
d14 29
a42 17
wclogrot is a utility to make the rotation and management of log files
easier. It was designed to be called from a cron job or some other
regularly scheduled process.

On many Unix systems, log files such as C</var/log/messages> will
accumulate until they are manually cleaned or rotated. A common
practice in rotating log files is to rename the current file from
C<messages> to C<messages.0>, and if C<messages.0> already exists, it
is renamed as C<messages.1> and so on.

wclogrot makes this process easier. One may simply invoke wclogrot
with some command-line options (see ``OPTIONS'' below) to customize
its behavior and the path to the log file which needs to be
rotated. wclogrot takes care of keeping the right number of old log
files on hand. It is able to send e-mail in the event of success and
failure (if so desired). It can also compress the logs to conserve
space using ``gzip''.
d52 1
a52 6
--mailto ``address''

  Send mail upon success or failure to the listed address. If rotation
  succeeds, the mail will contain a report of the old and new filename
  as well as the number of old log files that were removed (see the
  `keep' parameter). By default, all e-mail will go to root@@localhost.
d54 4
a57 4
--mail

  Enable the sending of mail to the address listed in
  `mailto'. Mailing is disabled by default.
d65 3
a67 7
  disabled by default.

--compress

  Enable compression of the rotated log files. Currently, the only
  supported compression program is GNU Zip (gzip). Compressed files
  will end in a .gz suffix. Compression is disabled by default.
a83 7
--zipcmd "/path/to/zip/program -and_options"

  Specify and alternate program to be used for compression. This is
  reserved for future use and shouldn't be used in the current
  version, as it is somewhat hard-wired for ``gzip -9''. This
  restriction will vanish in a future version.
