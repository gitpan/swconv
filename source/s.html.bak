<h1>SOURCE</h1>

Suppose that this is a file on shared-web.moc.com (or anywhere else)
which contains references to stuff that was also in /benadm/ on
shared-web (or wherever)

/benadm/ has been moved to mweb.fdy.moc.com.

So, we need to substitue any relative /benadm/ links as well
as any fully-qualified links to the old shared-web/benadm/
address.
